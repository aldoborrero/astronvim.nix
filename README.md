# AstroNvim.nix

My [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/) configuration with Nix!

## Why?

Having my configuration ready as a `flake` allows me to run `nvim` already configured to my taste wherever I want!

**Note**: This is a personal configuration tailored to my specific needs. Feel free to fork this repository and customize on your own!

## Setup

### \[Optional\] Add flake registry shortcut

You can add the following registry shortcut to type less characters:

```console
$ nix registry add astronvim github:aldoborrero/astronvim.nix
```

## Running AstroNvim

```console
$ nix run astronvim#astronvim
```
